## About 
This is a full-stack application built with React, Node, Express and MongoDB. Art News Scraper uses Cheerio to scrape and parse data from artnews.com. Data is then saved in MongoDB and returned to the front-end. GET, PUT, POST and DELETE routes enable the user to interact with the data and structure the data's movement across the application. 

#### Future Developments 
- Ability to read and write comments on articles. 
- Users will be able to login in to their own page where their personal articles will be saved and displayed.
- Ability to scrape multiple art sites and filter by article type, art type and/or date.
